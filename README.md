## This code is about Eye exercise.

Here's how to interact with the interface:

You will see 2 eyes on your screen. You will have to move mouse pointer in random direction. The Eyeball will move wherever the mouse pointer moves.

## How to Run: 
Download the ZIP file by clicking the CODE from the [Eye-Exercise Github Repository](https://github.com/PriyankaGeeta/Eye-Exercise). Double click on the Index.html file and run that in your browser.

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
I am planning to add a blinking eyelid when the mouse pointer is outside the blue zone, the eyelid will close.
